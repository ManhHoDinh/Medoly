## üíï Thanks
This project is almost completed like classical music app. However developed by the developer team who is still university students and have not enough experiences, this project maybe has some problem. You can visit our application on CHplay for more experience. Thank you for visiting our project.

I deeply appreciate every member of this team for showing relentless effort for this project.
